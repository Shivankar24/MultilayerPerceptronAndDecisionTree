# MultilayerPerceptronAndDecisionTree
A multilayer perceptron and a decision tree in python from scratch, and used
them to classify a customized data set which had 4 classes with reasonable accuracy. To run this project,
first run trainDT.py or the trainMLP.py file, on the basis of which the classifier is trained through the 
learning data sets. The executeDT.py or the executeMLP.py files are then run, which classify the test dataset
on the basis of what they leaarned earlier. Also attached are the results of running these classifiers; in the form of screenshots.
